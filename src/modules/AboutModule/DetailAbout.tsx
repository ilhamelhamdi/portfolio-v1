        I am a software engineer specializing in web development with a focus on
        frontend technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        My journey in the world of coding began in high school, where I
        discovered my love for technology and problem-solving. This passion led
        me to pursue a degree in Computer Science, where I&apos;ve honed my
        skills in various programming languages and frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast forward to today, I&apos;ve had privilege to work on different
        projects with many teams. My main focus today is to develop product
        solution with current technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are a few technology that I&apos;ve been working on my projects
        recently :
        <ul className="grid grid-cols-2 list-disc mx-8 mt-4">
          <li>JavaScript (ES6++)</li>
          <li>TypeScript</li>
          <li>ReactJS</li>
          <li>NextJS</li>
          <li>TailwindCSS</li>
          <li>Flutter</li>
          <li>Django</li>
          <li>Spring Boot</li>
          <li>NestJS</li>
          <li>ExpressJS</li>
          <li>PostgreSQL</li>
          <li>MongoDB</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
        For me each project is a new opportunity to learn new things, meet
        people with different ideas, and discover things about myself that I
        never knew.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to leave a positive mark behind me and create something impactful
        for people I work with.
      </p>

      </span>
      <p>I can make your new project comes to life</p>
    </section>
  );
};
